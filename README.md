### About Me
Hello, I'm Daniel Urbina, a student at NJIT pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I find joy in coding and bringing ideas to life. When I'm not busy studying and writing code, you can often find me unwinding with my record collection, indulging in my love for music. I'm keen on expanding my network, so feel free to reach out!
